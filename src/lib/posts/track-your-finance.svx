## Tired of Guessing Where Your Money Goes?

We've all been there. You get paid, bills are paid, you spend on daily needs, and somehow... the money disappears. Where did it all go?

If you're juggling expenses in both USD and Naira (like many Nigerians abroad or those dealing with international transactions), tracking your money gets even more complicated.

That's exactly why I built Flow.

## Meet Flow – Your Financial Companion
Flow is a simple, beautiful app that helps you:

- Track every expense in seconds
- See exactly where your money goes with visual breakdowns
- Switch between USD and Naira seamlessly
- Understand your habits so you can make better choices

And the best part? **It's completely free.**

## Why Flow is Different

#### 🇺🇸 🇳🇬 Dual Currency Support (USD & NGN)

Do you get paid in dollars but spend in naira? Or maybe you're a Nigerian professional working remotely? Flow handles both currencies effortlessly.

You can input expenses in whichever currency you used, and Flow automatically converts and tracks everything in the background. Switch views anytime – your ₦50,000 grocery run will show as dollars when you need it to.

## ⚡ It Takes 10 Seconds

Go to the => [website](https://flow-spense.pages.app) & install the platform on your mobile phone for easy access or browse through the online version

Open the app, type the amount, pick a category, done. You're more likely to track expenses when it doesn't feel like homework.

## 📊 See the Big Picture

Ever wonder how much you actually spend on "eating out" vs "groceries"? Flow shows you beautiful charts that reveal your real spending patterns. Sometimes seeing it visually is all the motivation you need to cut back.

## Real Talk: Why I Built This

I needed a finance tracker that understood my reality and to be accountable for all the income that leaves my hands.

ever wonder how you spend a huge amount of money but don't have
a proof to show where and how it left your hands. I made up my mind to keep record and proper documentations of my finance.

So I built Flow for people like us. No fluff, no complicated features you'll never use just clean, simple expense tracking that works the way we actually live.

## Getting Started Takes 2 Minutes

1. Open [FLOW](https://flow-spense.pages.app) on your phone or computer
2. Add your first expense
3. That's it. Start seeing where your money really goes.

Want the app on your home screen? Just tap "Share" (on iPhone) or "Add to Home Screen" (on Android) from your browser. Now it opens like any other app.

## What's Coming Next

I'm building Flow in the open and would love your input. Coming soon:

- Monthly budgets with alerts when you're close to limit
- Export your data to Excel/CSV
- Recurring expenses (rent, subscriptions, etc.)
- Dark mode (already here, actually!)
